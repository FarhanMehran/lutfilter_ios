# lutfilter_ios
LUT Filter iOS Project

This project demonstrates how to apply a LUT (Look-Up Table) filter to an image using the PRESET_Fujicolor_SuperHR100.cube file. The LUT file is included in the bundle and is used to modify the colors of the image based on the pre-defined color mappings in the .cube file.

Project Overview

The main purpose of this project is to show how to load and apply a 3D LUT filter using a `.cube` file on any image in an iOS app. In this example, we use the PRESET_Fujicolor_SuperHR100.cube to apply the effect to an image named "Apple".

Features:
- Load and apply LUT filters from a `.cube` file.
- Utilizes Core Image (CIFilter) for color transformations.
- Demonstrates basic image loading, processing, and displaying.
